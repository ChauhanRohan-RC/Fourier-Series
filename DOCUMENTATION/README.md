.............................................   FOURIER SERIES   (RC @May 17, 2022) .........................................

# A mathematical Fourier Series machine

1. Approximates any function (real, complex and even discontinous) in terms of Sines and Cosines
2. External Functions supported (in form of SVG vector data)
3. Save Rotor States to a file
4. Load a Synthetic Function from saved Rotor States
3. Many options and customisations

# Demo

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFbR1_0GCGw
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WbKhzp2rGw

# Usage

1. Install Java on your computer and add it to the path
2. Copy folder "out\artifacts\complex_jar" to your computer
2. click "launch.bat"

#  Define external path functions

1. create a file inside EXT_FUNCTIONS dir
2. copy path data inside file
3. use | (logical or) character as delimier to define multiple path data as single function

# Save-Load Rotors

1. CTRL-S: Save Rotor States to a file
2. CTRL-L: Load a Synthetic Function from saved Rotor States
